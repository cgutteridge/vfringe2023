Watch the Director (Jack Grossman) live-direct his company of comedians and guest performers in a melodramatic period piece (think Dickens meets Hugo), as they are showered with bottomless banana peels*!  Modern audiences are burdened by theatre etiquette – obligated to offer standing ovations and endless applause regardless of a performance’s quality. A Night of Drama pushes back against this stifling decorum, reclaiming the honesty of live theater that was celebrated centuries ago. By tossing out the rulebook (and a few banana peels*), the show delivers a liberating experience that reminds us what theatre can be: emotion evoking, unpredictable, and most importantly, fun.  The Director is determined to stage a stunning theatrical masterpiece, but instead, chaos erupts as performers and spectators alike embrace their whims and reject etiquette. Toss a banana peel*, join in a chant, or boo just because you feel like it. A Night of Drama is improvised clown madness with a dream to be grand and a mission to entertain. We use at least 70 bananas per show.  *banana peels provided

Stu inhabits his own unique visually rich world which is irresistibly inviting, filled with an optimism that sparkles as brightly as the vintage lurex threads in one of his bespoke fashion looks. From his roots in fashion design, cabaret performance and DJ-ing, Stu subsequently sharpened his skills as a theatre-maker. In recent years, he has honed his talents as a visual artist, creating strikingly beautiful dioramas, prints and ceramics. With his audience always at the heart of his stage work, he has developed and toured nationally with a number of unique, innovative and hilarious theatre shows.      boogaloostu.co.uk                                 instagram.com/boogaloostu

Previous productions include The Cabinet of Madame Fanny Du Thé (listed in The Guardian’s Best Shows at the Edinburgh Festival 2018), Undercover Christmas Club, FOOLS, and The Dead of Night in the Middle of Nowhere.     Reviews for previous shows:     “Their energy is boundless, the script fiercely intelligent and the original live music bound to stay dancing through your head.” (The Guardian)     “This is creative, imaginative theatre at its very best – and even the greatest cynic will likely be left feeling thoroughly entertained and amused.” (Bristol 24/7)     “Energetic, rich storytelling seasoned with a generous helping of genuine fun.” (A Younger Theatre)     “Through a whirlwind of tall tales and song, Riddlestick Theatre had me hanging onto their every oddity.” (EdFringeReview)     “The troupe are expert storytellers.” (Epigram Arts)

Ventnor Arts Club, High Street	2025-07-22	13:45	14:45	FLYWEIGHT	https://purchase.vfringe.co.uk/EventAvailability?EventId=19201	Spoken Word, Walks & Talks	A multimedia exploration of the poetry of boxing.     FLYWEIGHT is a new live literature production written and performed by award-winning poet Maggie Sawkins, that explores the unlikely theme of boxing, and in particular, female boxing. Combining poetry with nuggets of research and complemented by entertaining visuals and video sequences by filmmaker Matt Parsons, as well as audio contributions from boxers themselves, this is an engaging poetry show that really packs a punch. As one audience member remarked: "You don't have to like boxing or poetry for it to resonate". Directed for LLL Productions by Mark C. Hewitt.     Maggie Sawkins, based in Brading on the Isle of Wight, was winner in 2013 of the prestigious Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry for her multimedia production, Zones of Avoidance, also directed by Mark C. Hewitt. Speaking on behalf of the judges, Denise Rlley said of this work: “This is an ambitious multimedia presentation using film, voices and sound, which works exceptionally well. It is a challenging, painfully open account of a daughter’s addiction, yet it’s an account which also offers graceful good humour. Beautifully written and uncompromising, it’s a modern story that we felt the writer was compelled to tell; it acts as a vivid witness of harsh experiences which aren’t often described in poetry, and Maggie Sawkins’ illuminating descriptions will prove helpful for others to hear.”     FLYWEIGHT revisits the same techniques to create something altogether different.

'The laughs roll in like waves' Evening Standard    Basic Bloke 2 is Geoff’s first TOUR under a Labour government, so he’s got plenty to get off his chest! Geoff’s also taking advantage of the rediscovered tolerance towards jokes being jokes to tell you what he really thinks. How much he judges people. Bad parents, people who eat too much, anyone who wears a dressing gown beyond 9am… it’s fair to say the gloves are off.    'In his element on the stand up stage' Daily Mail    Unlike most sequels, Basic Bloke 2 will move beyond some of the themes of the original (while fully aware that a comedian doing a ‘sequel’ at all is a bit ridiculous). He’s been moving in male mental health circles for a while how, but while they’re all saying blokes should ‘check in’ on each other, he’s wondering what happens if you do ‘check in’ all the time but they mainly want to send you politically incorrect memes.

Ultimately though, Coach Party’s primary drive to write and perform music comes from “the often entertaining struggle of real life.”    With a new album on the way later this year, we’re very excited to have them perform for us at Ventnor fringe showcasing some new music alongside the big hits.    Support on the night comes from Brighton based alternative 5-piece ‘Highdrive’.

The Bosco @ Fringe Village, Ventnor Park	2025-07-19	14:00	15:00	Hidden Powers	https://purchase.vfringe.co.uk/EventAvailability?EventId=7601	Performing Arts	For the fifth year, Britain’s leading, 29-year-old autistic magician from Warwickshire is back on The Island!     Who’d have thunk it? It’s five years since Angus Baskerville first crossed The Solent to perform in Ventnor Park and he’s back again, with a brand-new show in a brand-new venue.  Last July saw Angus play to packed audiences at the Isle of Wight’s biggest arts festival, just a month before taking his show to Edinburgh Fringe for the first time where, again, he played to sell-out crowds, critical acclaim (“a show of really high quality” / FringeReview), and bagged  the prestigious Derek Award, for good measure! To round-out the year, this up-and-coming performer joined acclaimed hypnotist, Poldark, on a 20-date, theatre tour around the UK.    For Ventnor 2025, Angus will be a featured act in the historic Bosco Theatre, located in Ventnor Park. His all-new show – Hidden Powers – is a fascinating, continuing exploration of the connection between the power of the mind – certainly of Angus’ mind – as well as his own, very personal, story of growing up with (Angus’ words) “neurodivergent superpowers”. Informative & entertaining; poignant but funny; you will never leave a Baskerville show without having had both your mind blown, and your appreciation of growing up autistic advanced.

venue	2025-07-23	09:00	10:00	Gong in 60 Minutes!	https://purchase.vfringe.co.uk/EventAvailability?EventId=7201	Workshop	Immerse yourself in a chilled, meditative Soundscape at my new-for-Fringe series of Gong Baths. Each Gong Bath session will be a unique, captivating & nourishing Sound Hug. Slow down, connect, and let the Sound Waves wash over you. This is my 3rd year at Ventnor Fringe, and I’m delighted to be sharing this new Sound Experience with you all.  Bring your mat, blankets, eye shades & pillows for ultimate comfort.  WHAT TO EXPECT: A Sound Bath - or Sound Journey - is a deeply immersive, full-body listening experience that intentionally uses Sound Waves to invite gentle yet powerful therapeutic and restorative processes to rebalance your body and mind.  Participants lie or sit comfortably, with blankets, mats, pillows, eye masks etc. After a short, guided relaxation, with Metal Singing Bowls, you’ll experience different sounds & frequencies, from a variety of Gongs, followed by Chimes & Percussion.  The Sounds enable brain waves to transcend from BETA (Waking State) to ALPHA (Relaxed State), through to the THETA (Dream State) and possibly into DELTA (Restorative State). There is Rest in stillness and silence, at the end of the session, to allow the body to fully absorb and integrate the Sound and its therapeutic work.  Sound can work on both an Emotional and Physical level. Many participants ‘drift off’ & experience dreamlike states. Some also feel a ‘shifting’ of stuck Energy. Sound Therapy is wonderfully passive; no experience needed – all you need to do is turn up, get comfy and relax.  THE BENEFITS: Experiences include deep relaxation, energy shifts, tension release, mind calming, increased focus, improved sleep, visualisations/internal journeys.  ON THE DAY: Arrive 10 minutes early to settle in. Doors close promptly at start time. No Late Admissions.  CONTRAINDICATIONS: Please note: this event is not suitable for those with seizures, pacemakers, unmanaged mental health issues or who are pregnant. Please see my website for a full list of contraindications. Age 16+.

This has often led to an undeserved reputation or omission from history.  The Malcompris series attempts to examine the truth and retell events as they really happened with the aid of film clips and a live DJ playing retro vinyl records.  Hopefully, Malcompris will encourage you to have an open mind and look at events  from a different  angle. This may surprise or even upset people, but some stories deserve to be told.  Last year we performed Frankenstein "The true story". Our second narrative is about Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle a hugely successful black and white silent movie star popular at the beginning of the Hollywood phenomenon  at the start of the 20th century. He was implicated in a scandal that rocked and nearly destroyed the film industry at the time and as a consequence was the reason for his downfall and fall from grace.

It's estimated that they formed around 90% of the early European Settlers.    They of course took their musical traditions with them and, along with the influences brought by the victims of the slave trade, began the genesis of what was to become the now distinctive Appalachian "Old Time" sound.    Across the Pond explores the origin and development of both Appalachian music and wider American music genres, influenced by early British folk music as it travelled throughout the nation by an ever growing migrant population.

In a last attempt to understand and reconnect, he revisits the pivotal moments of his life but is left paralysed at the prospect of a future where his voice can’t be heard.    Where do young men stand in a world that seems to have no place for them?    Combining contemporary dance, theatre and spoken word, SUNNY SIDE is a raw portrayal of modern masculinity, informed by the voices of over 750 young people across the UK.

What is mindfulness? What makes gardening an ideal mindfulness activity? What are my favourite plants and why? How are flowers designed to support their favourite insects and how does climate change affect this. What can we do? How does this address the environmental issues besetting our wildlife as we reach global warming and encounter strange weather patterns? Can mindfulness enable us to cope with the challenges of weeds, and the crisis we all face? By exploring my own emotional responses to the challenges throughout the year, and the glorious celebrations of each season, I hope to present a gardening relationship that evokes positivity and happiness in the face of any challenges life may throw at us especially gardeners. Life can be interesting or overwhelming, with thousands of shades in between. How we understand ourselves and our relationships with our life is the key to enjoying and making the most of it.    The author has been gardening since early childhood with her grandma, and has been teaching mindfulness and writing books for over thirty years. She is passionate about it all.

Join Tim Cooper, winner of the Dublin Story Slam and host of the Ventnor Exchange Speakeasy, as he uses poetry of all forms from standup to spoken word and maybe even some stuff that rhymes to tell stories of modern life and what it means to be brave enough to love.     Maybe you’ve seen him at Yarnival or Speakeasy, or read him in Figlet, Brevity or VEXbomb? If you have, you know what to expect.    If not, now’s your chance to see “a superb orator” in a show which, in the words of previous audience members, “has the impact of theatre at its best”, “rooted in truth, intense but controlled”.    In this show Tim tells the story of a life of privilege and professional success overturned by tragedy, and how salvation is found in the unlikeliest of places. He takes cues from across the cultural spectrum, from the heights of Shakespeare to the very depths (Boris Johnson even makes a brief appearance in the background), but in the end the show is nothing more than a middle-aged white guy in a suit telling you his story. Sometimes he’s funny, sometimes it’s heartbreaking. The reason we hope you’ll join us – spoiler alert  – is that the conclusion of this story is the only truth in life is that we love and are able to be loved. Who amongst us doesn’t need to feel that?

Long ago, when the Island was wild and young, three powerful spirits were gifted to its waters—guardians of the rivers, protectors of the land. They are the Three Sisters: the radiant Maiden of the East Yar, the nurturing Mother of the Medina, and the wise Crone of the West Yar. Together, they keep the Island in harmony, weaving its magic through earth and sky, sea and stone.    But peace never lasts forever.    From the shadows comes a monstrous threat—a terrifying Wyrm, ancient and cruel, who seeks to corrupt the land and drain it of its life-giving magic. With fire and darkness, he casts the Island into despair, turning friends into foes and imprisoning the Sisters themselves. Hope fades. Light dims.    Until a hero rises.    Enter King Hengist—a warrior of heart as much as blade—who, with the help of an unlikely but courageous magical pony, sets out on an epic quest to free the Sisters, restore the land, and challenge the Wyrm in the skies above the Island.    The Three Sisters is a riot of energy and enchantment. Featuring original songs, puppetry, bold characters, and breathtaking theatrical moments, this is a family-friendly show that blends myth, humour, heroism, and just the right amount of mischief. Audiences will cheer, boo, laugh, and maybe even shed a tear as they journey through forests, face fearsome foes, and witness the magic of friendship and fate.    It’s a story about light versus dark, courage in the face of impossible odds, and the enduring power of the land we call home. So come along, bring the kids, bring your imagination, and prepare for a truly unforgettable Island legend… retold like never before.
