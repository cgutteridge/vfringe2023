The Flowersbrook Inn	2024-07-21	17:00	18:00	Nick Tann and The Whole Family Original Funk Review	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/75856		<p><strong>In 2019 I auditioned a guitarist, Andy Davey, for The Nick Tann Trio. I&rsquo;d formed the Trio with drummer Guy Siviour and double bass giant Bastien Terraz after quitting the singer/songwriter part of my life.</strong> Guy was a bass student of mine until I asked him to play congas for me. We picked up some Sofar gigs and played some crazy venues. Guy remains one of my favourite musicians to play with and one of the best to hang with.</p><p>Andy and I had played for the Celtic rock band Coast on their Scottish &amp; Danish tour in 2013. We got on really well and shared a few adventures. After the audition, Andy said &ldquo;Sorry, but what I really want is a nice tight, funky little band&rdquo; and declined to join us - but he had planted a seed. I decided then to evolve the Trio into something funkier. I wanted a keyboard player and contacted Jez Austin, who I had played with at jam nights in Southampton. I was chuffed when he agreed to join.</p><p>Jez is a proper music geek, and his creativity and natural talent has been instrumental in shaping our sound. The icing on the cake was securing Chris Rickets on trombone. Chris is renowned as a great jazzer and a safe pair of lips! Nick Tann and the Whole Family was born!</p><p>Ru Coleman replaced Bastien on bass and then in turn was replaced by Ben Williams, who I last played with in the 1990s in the funk band People. Ben is a force of nature and one of the nicest people on this planet. He and Guy make the most interesting, fun and dynamic rhythm section you can experience. We are centred in the original jazz, funk and groove camp playing a mixture of funky versions of my solo stuff and brand new songs. Our studio recordings can be found on Spotify and live performances are where we really pop!</p><p>I have played at the Ventnor Fringe Festival most years since 2012 as a solo singer songwriter - and I am so excited to be back in 2024 with the Whole Family. We have tons of new funky songs for you, and we&rsquo;ll be introducing our newest member, guitarist Andy Davey.</p><p><strong>Show Information</strong></p><p><strong>Duration&nbsp;</strong>60mins (no interval)<strong>&nbsp;Age Suitability:&nbsp;</strong>All Ages&nbsp;<strong>Culture Pass 2for1 Tickets&nbsp;</strong>Yes (<a href="https://ventnorexchange.co.uk/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="a"><strong><u>Sign up here</u></strong></a>)</p><p><strong>Accessibility Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong>&nbsp;No steps to venue but steep slope to Flowersbrook Field.

Ventnor Arts Club	2024-07-23	14:00	14:20	Film Screening: Zedhead - An Otherworldly Adventure!	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/76458		<p>Zedhead is an experimental stop-motion film, made by a Ventnor-based creative who has never worked in this medium before. The idea was to create a miniature world, that echoes the vast and bewildering world that we find ourselves thrown into at birth.</p><p>It&rsquo;s an attempt to capture some of the mystery, beauty, absurdity and pain that people experience every day, and to make sense of it all. Suggesting that just maybe, there is some underlying meaning and purpose behind it, albeit deeply hidden.</p><p>The film took around 18 months to complete, and involved a great deal of blood, sweat, tears, joy, anxiety, confusion, isolation, and back pain. Who would have thought making millions of tiny adjustments to characters, props and scenery, and photographing every adjustment, and air-brushing those images before editing them all together would be so challenging?</p><p>The film represents a journey on several levels. The journey of Zedhead, the plucky hero who stumbles through a strange world and tries to decipher it as he goes along, and also the journey of the film-maker, who began knowing nothing about the process, and had to learn everything on-the-hoof and from scratch. From lighting and prop making, to working with armatures, to adding special effects, music and sound effects.</p><p>Many mistakes were made, and the film does have a rough-and-ready aesthetic, but that&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m self-critical of. In fact, I like the rawness of how it looks. It&rsquo;s flawed, and it reveals its humanity through its flaws, along with (I hope), glimpses of humour and beauty. The film, like its hero, grows as it stumbles along.</p><p>Why did I make this film? In the hope that it serves as a vehicle to connect with others, especially creatives, so that the next project is a shared experience - a journey that&rsquo;s a little less isolating, and a little more fun. If that might be you, you can get in touch at zedhead.org.</p><p><strong>Show Information</strong></p><p><strong>Duration&nbsp;</strong>20mins <strong>Age Suitability:&nbsp;</strong>12+&nbsp;<strong>Culture / Unlimited Pass 2for1 Tickets&nbsp;</strong>No </p><p><strong>Accessibility Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong>&nbsp;One step to building, steps to toilets.&nbsp;<strong>Wheelchair Spaces:</strong>&nbsp;No&nbsp;<strong>Accessible Toilets:</strong>&nbsp;No&nbsp;<strong>Standing/Seated:</strong>&nbsp;Seated</p>

Ventnor Arts Club	2024-07-23	16:30	17:50	Film Screening: Boxed In	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/76484		<p>The world is ending today. Everyone knows it. No one can stop it. All that remains is to decide how to spend those final few hours. For Hugh Biggsby, the host of Oaksbury Support Group, his vocation has never been more necessary. Held in the townhall at the heart of the local Oaksbury community, the support group has been a safe space for many years, offering those who attend the chance to speak and be heard. Now, as the apocalypse looms frighteningly close, an eclectic clash of personalities gather one last time at the Oaksbury Support Group to confront the end as optimists, realists, nihilists and pessimists...</p><p>Filmed on the Isle of Wight with a local cast and crew of just four people, Boxed In is a claustrophobic dark comedy that serves as a parable for control, entrapment and codependency. We are thrilled that Ventnor Fringe will be hosting the public premiere for this film!</p><p>In the winter of 2023 and with funding from Arts Council England, Boxed In was conceived, written and performed as a small one act play at the Isle of Wight College with a cast of four. Following the reception of this (and the eagerness of the cast), the script was adapted into a screenplay ready to be filmed on location in Shanklin over the course of three intense days. Shot in black and white with a cropped aspect ratio and a slightly experimental style, it is visually very different from the performed piece but tonally very similar, exploring new ideas through camera angles and editing that were otherwise impossible to accomplish on stage. The chamber piece nature of the story all being set in one location, with the apocalypse something that is felt but never seen, draws you into the world through the eyes of the characters, who you will come to understand without ever fully knowing them.</p><p>Written and Directed by Sam Lapham, an aspiring filmmaker and actor based out of Shanklin, the film also stars Chris Beard, Chelsea Holmberg and Emma Turner, all reprising their role from the stage.</p><p><strong>Show Information</strong></p><p><strong>Duration&nbsp;</strong>80mins (no interval)<strong>&nbsp;Age Suitability:&nbsp;</strong>16+&nbsp;<strong>Culture / Unlimited Pass 2for1 Tickets&nbsp;</strong>No</p><p><strong>Accessibility Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong>&nbsp;One step to building, steps to toilets.&nbsp;<strong>Wheelchair Spaces:</strong>&nbsp;No&nbsp;<strong>Accessible Toilets:</strong>&nbsp;No&nbsp;<strong>Standing/Seated:</strong>&nbsp;Seated</p>

A medieval marvel! Let us take you back in time.... Take a trip with us to Devonshire and Yorkshire, the Isle of Wight and London.</strong> </p><p>King Henry III had ruled since he was 9 years old. He was spoilt but weak, and he caused England to be thrown into a terrifying civil war for a few years because he refused to comply with the Magna Charter that his father, the infamous King John, had been forced to sign by the Barons. Women had very few rights. They were used as strategic pieces by their fathers who arranged suitable marriages for them, to form alliances. Then, their prime role was to produce babies and particularly male heirs. Many died in childbirth. So how did Isabella survive? Well - get some tickets and enjoy our show. This is a fast moving and surprising piece of theatre which balances historical detail with pure entertainment and some beautiful music. Get to know Isabella as she grows from childhood to womanhood, her trials and her victories, her allies and her enemies.

Pier Street Playhouse	2024-07-24	18:00	19:00	Isabella: The Last Queen of the Wight	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/76505		<p><strong>Come and meet Isabella de Fortibus, an independent and feisty lady of the 13th century England. A medieval marvel! Let us take you back in time.... Take a trip with us to Devonshire and Yorkshire, the Isle of Wight and London.</strong> </p><p>King Henry III had ruled since he was 9 years old. He was spoilt but weak, and he caused England to be thrown into a terrifying civil war for a few years because he refused to comply with the Magna Charter that his father, the infamous King John, had been forced to sign by the Barons. Women had very few rights. They were used as strategic pieces by their fathers who arranged suitable marriages for them, to form alliances. Then, their prime role was to produce babies and particularly male heirs. Many died in childbirth. So how did Isabella survive? Well - get some tickets and enjoy our show. This is a fast moving and surprising piece of theatre which balances historical detail with pure entertainment and some beautiful music. Get to know Isabella as she grows from childhood to womanhood, her trials and her victories, her allies and her enemies. What was she really like?</p><p></p><p><strong>Show Information</strong></p><p><strong>Duration&nbsp;</strong>60mins (no interval)<strong>&nbsp;Age Suitability:&nbsp;</strong>12+&nbsp;<strong>Culture Pass 2for1 Tickets&nbsp;</strong>No (<a href="https://ventnorexchange.co.uk/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="a"><strong><u>Sign up here</u></strong></a>)</p><p><strong>Accessibility Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong>&nbsp;Step free&nbsp;<strong>Wheelchair Spaces:</strong>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<strong>Accessible Toilets:</strong>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<strong>Standing/Seated:</strong>&nbsp;Seated</p>

To his acclaimed powerful vocals, virtuoso guitar and pro-level songwriting, he now adds proficient playwright, stage production and acting skills. Accompanied by his vintage 12-string guitar, Andy both enacts and recounts his tale of adventure, passion, anguish and pursuit of ideals, bringing to life the true spirit of the age.</p><p>The journey is not just his own but a universal story of chasing dreams, confronting challenges, and the power of independent discovery. With meanings amplified by these original songs speaking across five decades, the performance resonates with timeless themes of seeking, rejection, love, loss, resilience and acceptance, all amplified by the rich, emotive music of fine guitar picking and soothing articulate singing.</p><p>'Boulevard Days' builds on the genres of the One Person Show and Gig Theatre to explore new modes. History, entertainment and art intersect to push the envelope in an intimate exploration of vulnerable human life. Early previews have hailed it as "highly entertaining," "his best work yet," and &ldquo;A strong story and interesting show,&rdquo; with audiences keenly awaiting the full debut at the 2024 Ventnor Fringe Festival in July.</p><p>Get your tickets now and then join us for 'Boulevard Days - A Play with Songs'.

He was spoilt but weak, and he caused England to be thrown into a terrifying civil war for a few years because he refused to comply with the Magna Charter that his father, the infamous King John, had been forced to sign by the Barons.

A medieval marvel! Let us take you back in time.... Take a trip with us to Devonshire and Yorkshire, the Isle of Wight and London.</strong> </p><p>King Henry III had ruled since he was 9 years old. He was spoilt but weak, and he caused England to be thrown into a terrifying civil war for a few years because he refused to comply with the Magna Charter that his father, the infamous King John, had been forced to sign by the Barons. Women had very few rights. They were used as strategic pieces by their fathers who arranged suitable marriages for them, to form alliances. Then, their prime role was to produce babies and particularly male heirs. Many died in childbirth. So how did Isabella survive? Well - get some tickets and enjoy our show. This is a fast moving and surprising piece of theatre which balances historical detail with pure entertainment and some beautiful music. Get to know Isabella as she grows from childhood to womanhood, her trials and her victories, her allies and her enemies. What was she really like?</p><p></p><p><strong>Show Information</strong></p><p><strong>Duration&nbsp;</strong>60mins (no interval)<strong>&nbsp;Age Suitability:&nbsp;</strong>12+&nbsp;<strong>Culture Pass 2for1 Tickets&nbsp;</strong>No (<a href="https://ventnorexchange.co.uk/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="a"><strong><u>Sign up here</u></strong></a>)</p><p><strong>Accessibility Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong>&nbsp;Step free&nbsp;<strong>Wheelchair Spaces:</strong>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<strong>Accessible Toilets:</strong>&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;<strong>Standing/Seated:</strong>&nbsp;Seated</p>

It brings forth a world where ghosts, witches, and magic hold sway over the imaginations of those who dare to watch; where the line between the living and the dead becomes blurred. The tales include the tragic story of Ann Penny, a haunting story of love, betrayal, and revenge that has echoed through the ages. We also Little Jane Squibb a voice, one that you may never have head before - a legacy that refuses to be forgotten.</p><p>"Wyrd Wight Tales" doesn't just focus on the well-known -- we will present lesser-known stories that are no less chilling.

The truth behind this enigma is slowly unravelled through a combination haunting music, song and original choreography. Throughout the show you&rsquo;ll be treated to a feast of aural of landscapes and atmospheric settings that perfectly complement the eerie atmosphere of the stories being told. Stories from the windswept cliffs of Culver to the darkest woodlands of Newtown, the Island is the canvas of which these tales are painted.

Ventnor Arts Club	2024-07-27	21:30	23:00	Laurie McVay and the High Rollers: The Soul of the Blues	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/75447		<p>'If you want soulful, classy blues with a jazzy tinge, Laurie McVay is your man'. So said Blues in Britain magazine and it&rsquo;s hard to disagree. This show will take audiences to a place where blues meets soul and jazz - to irresistible effect. Laurie McVay and the High Rollers take a fresh, vibrant approach to the music. Audiences may pick up on a range of echoes &ndash; such as Ray Charles and B,B.King - but the sound is totally contemporary, emotionally tuned to unleash the eternal &lsquo;Soul of the Blues&rsquo;.</p><p>Laurie McVay is a blues singer/songwriter/musician, who takes a distinctly modern and eclectic approach to his bluescraft. His approach was described by one critic as &lsquo;uniquely soulful and uncommonly melodic&rsquo; and it has been faithfully represented on his two albums to date, My Kind of Blues (2014) and East Side Blues (2019). McVay is also a committed and passionate performer, whose vocal approach has been compared to a range of blues and soul heroes, including Sam Cooke and Bobby Bland.

Pier Street Playhouse	2024-07-28	18:00	19:00	Wyrd Wight Tales	https://ventnorexchange.littleboxoffice.com/events/76713		<p><strong>"Wyrd Wight Tales" is a captivating production that delves deep into the rich tapestry of folklore and legends originating from the Isle of Wight.</strong> </p><p>With its roots entrenched in the eerie and the supernatural, the show weaves together a collection of haunting tales that have been passed down through generations, promising a journey into the heart of darkness and mystery.At its core, "Wyrd Wight Tales" is a celebration of Island oral tradition, where stories were once shared around flickering firesides to both entertain and terrify. The show breathes new life into these partly forgotten narratives by using a combination of music, dance and dramatic storytelling. It brings forth a world where ghosts, witches, and magic hold sway over the imaginations of those who dare to watch; where the line between the living and the dead becomes blurred. The tales include the tragic story of Ann Penny, a haunting story of love, betrayal, and revenge that has echoed through the ages. We also Little Jane Squibb a voice, one that you may never have head before - a legacy that refuses to be forgotten.</p><p>"Wyrd Wight Tales" doesn't just focus on the well-known -- we will present lesser-known stories that are no less chilling. One such tale is "Baron Corvus," a mysterious fable shrouded in secrecy and whispers. The truth behind this enigma is slowly unravelled through a combination haunting music, song and original choreography.
