    "description": "A multimedia exploration of the poetry of boxing. \r\n\r\nFLYWEIGHT is a new live literature production written and performed by award-winning poet Maggie Sawkins, that explores the unlikely theme of boxing, and in particular, female boxing.

To round-out the year, this up-and-coming performer joined acclaimed hypnotist, Poldark, on a 20-date, theatre tour around the UK.\r\n\r\nFor Ventnor 2025, Angus will be a featured act in the historic Bosco Theatre, located in Ventnor Park. His all-new show – Hidden Powers – is a fascinating, continuing exploration of the connection between the power of the mind – certainly of Angus’ mind – as well as his own, very personal, story of growing up with (Angus’ words) “neurodivergent superpowers”.

    "description": "Immerse yourself in a chilled, meditative Soundscape at my new-for-Fringe series of Gong Baths. Each Gong Bath session will be a unique, captivating & nourishing Sound Hug. Slow down, connect, and let the Sound Waves wash over you. This is my 3rd year at Ventnor Fringe, and I’m delighted to be sharing this new Sound Experience with you all.\r\nBring your mat, blankets, eye shades & pillows for ultimate comfort.\r\nWHAT TO EXPECT: A Sound Bath - or Sound Journey - is a deeply immersive, full-body listening experience that intentionally uses Sound Waves to invite gentle yet powerful therapeutic and restorative processes to rebalance your body and mind.\r\nParticipants lie or sit comfortably, with blankets, mats, pillows, eye masks etc. After a short, guided relaxation, with Metal Singing Bowls, you’ll experience different sounds & frequencies, from a variety of Gongs, followed by Chimes & Percussion.\r\nThe Sounds enable brain waves to transcend from BETA (Waking State) to ALPHA (Relaxed State), through to the THETA (Dream State) and possibly into DELTA (Restorative State). There is Rest in stillness and silence, at the end of the session, to allow the body to fully absorb and integrate the Sound and its therapeutic work.\r\nSound can work on both an Emotional and Physical level. Many participants ‘drift off’ & experience dreamlike states. Some also feel a ‘shifting’ of stuck Energy. Sound Therapy is wonderfully passive; no experience needed – all you need to do is turn up, get comfy and relax.\r\nTHE BENEFITS: Experiences include deep relaxation, energy shifts, tension release, mind calming, increased focus, improved sleep, visualisations/internal journeys.\r\nON THE DAY: Arrive 10 minutes early to settle in. Doors close promptly at start time. No Late Admissions.\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: Please note: this event is not suitable for those with seizures, pacemakers, unmanaged mental health issues or who are pregnant. Please see my website for a full list of contraindications. Age 16+.",

    "description": "Mathemagical – Where Numbers and Illusion Collide\r\nThink mathematics is all dry formulas and classroom boredom? Think again! Mathemagical is a dazzling, brain-tingling journey into the surprising world where magic and maths meet. This unique event reveals the secrets behind some of the most mind-bending magic tricks in existence—and explores the beautiful, often baffling mathematics that makes them possible.\r\n\r\nFrom number patterns that predict the impossible to tricks that seem to defy logic and reason, Mathemagical will entertain, intrigue, and challenge your perception of what both maths and magic can be. Expect audience participation, clever puzzles, and a few jaw-dropping moments that will leave you wondering, “How did that work?”\r\n\r\nWhether you adored maths at school or still have nightmares about it, this show is designed with you in mind.

With a new horn, a picnic hamper...and a sail, will Mrs Armitage be able to keep her bicycle in one piece or will her crazy contraption prove too much to handle?\r\n\r\nAdapted from Quentin Blake’s classic tale,Mrs Armitage on Wheels, Scoot Theatre presents a 40-minute interactive, energetic show, celebrating the joy of getting outdoors and being active. Scoot Theatre’s adaptation is a fun, family show suitable for aged 3+ and particularly enjoyable to primary-aged children, featuring live music, puppetry and physical comedy, MrsArmitage on Wheelscelebrates the power of imagination, the importance of resilience and the joy of embracing the great outdoors. Partnering with Farnham Maltings and Arts Partnership Surrey, Scoot Theatre have developed Mrs Armitage on Wheels as a touring production through collaborative theatre workshops in several Surrey schools and nurseries. Developing the story with early years and primary children has created a highly physical, almost non-verbal performance, drawing heavily on clowning and playfulness. \r\nThe piece is accessible on many levels, with wide audience appeal.\r\n\r\nScoot Theatre is particularly interested in performing in non-traditional spaces to engage new audiences and is keen to work with local businesses to create or enhance community events. This co-production will extend the appeal of the show using Farnham Maltings’expertise in taking shows to non-traditional arts spaces like libraries, cricket clubs and community centres. New collaborations could include bike shops and cafes, youth and children’s centres, nurseries and community fetes, who may wish to offer activities to wraparound performances.",

DARKFIELD has toured globally, reaching over 550,000 audiences across the UK, Asia, Australia, North America, Saudi, Turkey and Mexico. The experiences have featured in major film festivals including BFI London Film Festival, Venice, IDFA, Tribeca, Raindance, SXSW and in 2021 won Columbia’s Digital Storytelling Lab’s Breakthrough Award in recognition of the year’s most innovative narrative.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/arI_CMQv3Ec?si=VKYFQtxNCMZaZaQp\"> WATCH TRAILER </a><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Venue:</span> <span><br/></span>The Container @ Ingrams Yard, Dudley Road<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Tickets:</span> General Admission £13.00, Group of 4 £60, Culture/ Unlimited Pass 2 for 1 (Tues only)<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Age Rating:</span> 16+<span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">Duration:</span> 30 Minutes<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Accessibility: <span><br/></span><span class=\"BoldText\">This experience takes place in complete darkness.

From Tudor Queens to Pop Icons, the SIX wives of Henry VIII take the mic to remix five hundred years of historical heartbreak into a Euphoric Celebration of 21st-century girl power!

    "description": "This book & illustrated talk explores a year in the life of an Isle of Wight country garden, complete with resident and visiting characters. What is mindfulness? What makes gardening an ideal mindfulness activity? What are my favourite plants and why? How are flowers designed to support their favourite insects and how does climate change affect this. What can we do? How does this address the environmental issues besetting our wildlife as we reach global warming and encounter strange weather patterns? Can mindfulness enable us to cope with the challenges of weeds, and the crisis we all face? By exploring my own emotional responses to the challenges throughout the year, and the glorious celebrations of each season, I hope to present a gardening relationship that evokes positivity and happiness in the face of any challenges life may throw at us especially gardeners. Life can be interesting or overwhelming, with thousands of shades in between. How we understand ourselves and our relationships with our life is the key to enjoying and making the most of it.\r\n\r\nThe author has been gardening since early childhood with her grandma, and has been teaching mindfulness and writing books for over thirty years.

By exploring my own emotional responses to the challenges throughout the year, and the glorious celebrations of each season, I hope to present a gardening relationship that evokes positivity and happiness in the face of any challenges life may throw at us especially gardeners. Life can be interesting or overwhelming, with thousands of shades in between. How we understand ourselves and our relationships with our life is the key to enjoying and making the most of it.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>The author has been gardening since early childhood with her grandma, and has been teaching mindfulness and writing books for over thirty years.

As she rounded Dunnose Point on the Isle of Wight, a sudden snow squall struck. In minutes, she keeled over and sank, taking more than 300 souls with her. The tragedy was one of the worst peacetime naval disasters in British history.\r\n\r\nBut the story didn’t end there.\r\n\r\nOver the years, sailors, fishermen, and islanders have reported eerie sightings of a ghostly ship drifting silently off the coast—always in the same place, always vanishing without trace.

So what really happened to HMS Eurydice… and is she still out there?\r\n\r\nPart magic show, part historical lecture, and part chilling eyewitness account, The Magical Tale of HMS Eurydice is a spellbinding theatrical experience that brings together illusion, storytelling, and maritime mystery. This captivating one-man show is presented by Ian Vallance, an Associate Member of the Inner Magic Circle—one of the world’s most prestigious societies for magicians—and the Education Officer of the Shipwreck Centre in Arreton, where the wrecks and relics of the past are kept alive through expert interpretation.\r\n\r\nWith sleight-of-hand, historical insight, and a few unexplained surprises, Ian will lead you through the true story of HMS Eurydice’s tragic final voyage—and her ghostly reappearances.

    "description": "The Three Sisters is a bold and magical new stage adventure from the Tide Nor Time Players, inspired by ancient Isle of Wight folklore and reimagined for audiences of all ages.\r\n\r\nLong ago, when the Island was wild and young, three powerful spirits were gifted to its waters—guardians of the rivers, protectors of the land. They are the Three Sisters: the radiant Maiden of the East Yar, the nurturing Mother of the Medina, and the wise Crone of the West Yar. Together, they keep the Island in harmony, weaving its magic through earth and sky, sea and stone.\r\n\r\nBut peace never lasts forever.\r\n\r\nFrom the shadows comes a monstrous threat—a terrifying Wyrm, ancient and cruel, who seeks to corrupt the land and drain it of its life-giving magic. With fire and darkness, he casts the Island into despair, turning friends into foes and imprisoning the Sisters themselves. Hope fades. Light dims.\r\n\r\nUntil a hero rises.\r\n\r\nEnter King Hengist—a warrior of heart as much as blade—who, with the help of an unlikely but courageous magical pony, sets out on an epic quest to free the Sisters, restore the land, and challenge the Wyrm in the skies above the Island.\r\n\r\nThe Three Sisters is a riot of energy and enchantment. Featuring original songs, puppetry, bold characters, and breathtaking theatrical moments, this is a family-friendly show that blends myth, humour, heroism, and just the right amount of mischief. Audiences will cheer, boo, laugh, and maybe even shed a tear as they journey through forests, face fearsome foes, and witness the magic of friendship and fate.\r\n\r\nIt’s a story about light versus dark, courage in the face of impossible odds, and the enduring power of the land we call home. So come along, bring the kids, bring your imagination, and prepare for a truly unforgettable Island legend… retold like never before.",
