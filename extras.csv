Jack’s an Observational pun artist who looks at life with a unique perspective. His combined style is like no one else, both enlightening and hilarious, relatable to all.
Emma looks at life differently, in fact it would be accurate to say she’s interested in the absurdity of death! Emma challenges what can be a taboo subject for many and puts a positive and humorous spin on what happens to us when we die.
Come and satisfy your curiosity by experiencing life and death through the eyes of two unique and entertaining individuals.
“Jack is so funny. A real joy to watch and impossible not to like, his jokes are really good and the running commentary and critique he gives of his set is totally unique and quite brilliant,” – Paul McCaffrey.
“Emma is delightfully dark. She’s also very funny,” – Matt Roseblade at Fat Fox Comedy",,,,

It is a 45 minutes, one-woman show in which I perform the archaeology of the haunted shipwreck- WW1 submarine chaser-'Movy' M.L.286, whose remains are hulked on the Thames foreshore in West London. Utilising sea shanties, poetry, personal accounts from the officers of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) who served in the WW1 Motor Launch Patrol, as well as the narratives of my research participants, and my own narrative, I interpret the archaeology of the decaying vessel through stories and song. I have performed ""Still Life 'Movy'"" within the archaeological remains of M.L.286, but for off-site performances, I have built a replica of the vessel's transom to be able to take my show to various venues. On the 13th May, 2023, I will be performing ""Still Life 'Movy'"" at Southampton City Art Gallery, as two of Lt Cdr Geoffrey Stephen Allfree's paintings are part of the gallery's collection. Lt Allfree was Commander of M.L.286 and drowned at sea on the 29th September, 1918. He was 29 years old. Lt Cdr Geoffrey Stephen Allfree RNVR RBA, is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial on Southsea Common. ""Still Life 'Movy'"" is my tribute to Lt Cdr Allfree RNVR RBA, to his vessel M.L.286, and to all the RNVR officers who served in the WW1 Motor Launch Patrol.",,,,,
